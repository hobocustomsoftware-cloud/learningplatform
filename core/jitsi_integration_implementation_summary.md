# Jitsi Integration Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the Jitsi Meet integration in the learning platform. The implementation provides role-based access control for live classes, ensuring that:

- **Admin/Instructor roles** can start meetings as hosts with full permissions
- **Student roles** can only join meetings as participants with limited permissions

The solution is designed to be similar to Udemy's live class implementation with enhanced security features.

## Changes Made

### 1. LiveClass Model Enhancement

Enhanced the LiveClass model with automatic room name generation:

- Added `room_name` field with unique constraint
- Implemented automatic generation of unique room names using course ID and random string
- Ensured room names are not guessable for security

### 2. JWT Token Generation

Implemented secure JWT token generation for Jitsi meetings:

- Added `generate_jitsi_token()` utility function in `classroom/utils.py`
- Configured JWT tokens with appropriate expiration (1 hour)
- Included user context with role information in tokens
- Added Jitsi app ID and secret configuration

### 3. Role-Based Access Control

Enhanced role-based access control for Jitsi meetings:

- **Admin/Instructor**: Host privileges with ability to record, disable lobby
- **Student**: Participant privileges with lobby mode enabled, no recording
- Proper permission checking in API endpoints

### 4. Feature Flag Implementation

Implemented feature flags based on user roles:

| Feature | Admin/Instructor | Student |
|---------|------------------|---------|
| Lobby Mode | Disabled | Enabled |
| Recording | Enabled | Disabled |
| Pre-join Page | Enabled | Enabled |

### 5. API Endpoint Enhancement

Enhanced the LiveClassViewSet with improved endpoints:

- `/start/` endpoint for hosts to start meetings
- `/join/` endpoint for participants to join meetings
- Proper error handling and permission checking
- Detailed response with all necessary Jitsi configuration

## Implementation Files

### 1. Model Enhancement
- **File**: `classroom/models.py`
- **Changes**: Added `room_name` field with automatic generation

### 2. Utility Functions
- **File**: `classroom/utils.py` (new)
- **Content**: JWT token generation function

### 3. API Endpoints
- **File**: `classroom/views.py`
- **Changes**: Enhanced `join()` and `start()` methods with JWT tokens and feature flags

### 4. Serializers
- **File**: `classroom/serializers.py`
- **Changes**: Updated to include `room_name` field

### 5. Configuration
- **Files**: `.env` and `core/settings.py`
- **Changes**: Added Jitsi app ID and secret configuration

### 6. Dependencies
- **File**: `requirements.txt` (new)
- **Changes**: Added PyJWT and cryptography dependencies

## Security Features

### 1. JWT Token Security
- Short-lived tokens (1 hour expiration)
- Secure signing with HS256 algorithm
- User context embedded in tokens

### 2. Room Name Security
- Unique, non-guessable room names
- Pattern: `course{course_id}-{random_string}`
- Database uniqueness constraint

### 3. Role-Based Permissions
- Proper Django permission classes
- Enrollment verification for students
- Role verification for hosts

### 4. Feature Flag Security
- Lobby mode for student participants
- Recording restrictions for non-hosts
- Pre-join page for all users

## API Response Format

The API returns all necessary information for Flutter integration:

```json
{
  "room": "course123-abc123def456",
  "subject": "Introduction to Python Programming",
  "jitsi_server_url": "https://meet.jit.si",
  "jitsi_domain": "meet.jit.si",
  "token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...",
  "feature_flags": {
    "lobby-mode.enabled": true,
    "prejoinpage.enabled": true,
    "recording.enabled": false
  },
  "is_moderator": false
}
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Environment Setup

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Add Jitsi app ID and secret to `.env`:
   ```
   JITSI_APP_ID=your_jitsi_app_id
   JITSI_APP_SECRET=your_jitsi_app_secret
   ```

3. Run database migrations:
   ```
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

### 2. API Testing

1. **Admin/Instructor starting live class (host privileges)**
   - Call the `/start/` endpoint with admin/instructor credentials
   - Verify that the response includes a JWT token and appropriate feature flags

2. **Student joining live class (participant privileges)**
   - Call the `/join/` endpoint with student credentials
   - Verify that the response includes a JWT token and appropriate feature flags

3. **Student access control (enrolled vs non-enrolled)**
   - Try to join a live class as a non-enrolled student
   - Verify that access is denied

4. **Security features (JWT expiration, room name uniqueness)**
   - Verify that JWT tokens expire after 1 hour
   - Verify that room names are unique and non-guessable

### 3. Flutter Integration Testing

1. Use the API response to configure the Jitsi Meet SDK
2. Verify that the room name, JWT token, and feature flags are correctly applied
3. Test both moderator and participant experiences

## Deployment Considerations

### Environment Configuration

1. Add Jitsi app ID and secret to `.env`:
   ```
   JITSI_APP_ID=your_jitsi_app_id
   JITSI_APP_SECRET=your_jitsi_app_secret
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run database migrations:
   ```
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

### Security Best Practices

1. Keep Jitsi app secret secure
2. Use HTTPS in production
3. Regularly rotate JWT secrets
4. Monitor meeting usage and access logs

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a secure, role-based Jitsi Meet integration that enhances the learning platform's live class functionality. The solution ensures appropriate permissions for different user roles while maintaining security best practices.

The API is designed for easy Flutter integration with all necessary configuration information provided in the response. Comprehensive documentation and testing instructions ensure smooth implementation and deployment.
